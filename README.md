# TOP-BANK-APP
A fundamental banking app that displays transactions, allows to transfer money and request for loan.
All this can be done once the user has logged in using correct credentials. So successful login is also implemented in the project.
The app was created using HTML,CSS and Javascript and uses DOM manipulation.
The timer related activities are also implemented in the application using Javascript's time related methods(such as setTimeOut(),setInterval() and clearInterval()).
